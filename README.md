I was born in Srinagar, J&K and Grew up there, I'm 15 and I'm doing my Schooling in Srinagar (Burn Hall School). 

Howdy, my name is Sareer Showket Mir. Since the age of 12, I've had a keen interest in computer science. I'm a web developer and creative graphic designer with original ideas and a distinctive approach to images. As the COVID Lockdown began, I did begin my graphic design career without any professional direction. After that, I launched my own Instagram account under the handle @dev_sareer, where I advertised my design and development skills. My passion for communication drew me to public relations where, I've designed and developed for a variety of clients in a variety of sectors. I'm currently working towards slightly eradicating young unemployment in Jammu and Kashmir. My aim is to first succeed at JEE and later establish my own company is my ultimate goal.
